# ICATS-FHM 2026 — best poster vote

Attendees type the numbers of their top 3 posters from a phone. 3-2-1 points, top 8 win.
Static site on GitHub Pages, ballots stored in a Google Sheet via Apps Script.
Voters identify themselves by typing their name as printed on their conference ID card.
Names are recorded as given and **not** checked against a roster, so duplicates are
possible — `tally()` warns about repeated names before you announce.

```
index.html              ballot page
config.js               endpoint URL + open/close switch
css/style.css
js/app.js
data/posters.json       the 54 posters  ← replace this
apps-script/Code.gs     paste into Apps Script
tools/make-posters.html  CSV → posters.json
tools/print-codes.html   unused — left over from the retired voting-code scheme
```

## 1. Poster list

Export the abstract list as CSV with header `id,title,presenter,affiliation,theme`,
open `tools/make-posters.html`, paste, download, and overwrite `data/posters.json`.
IDs must be `P01`–`P54` and must match the numbers printed on the boards.

## 2. Sheet + backend

1. New Google Sheet → Extensions → Apps Script.
2. Delete the starter code, paste all of `apps-script/Code.gs`, save.
3. Reload the Sheet. A **Poster vote** menu appears → **Set up sheets**.
   Authorise when prompted.
4. In Apps Script: **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**.
   Execute as **Me**, Who has access **Anyone**. Copy the `/exec` URL.

Set `POSTER_COUNT` in `Code.gs` if you don't have exactly 54.

### Verify the deployment before anything else

Open the `/exec` URL in a **private/incognito window**. You must see JSON:

```json
{"ok":true,"service":"icats-poster-vote","posters":54,"ballots":0}
```

If you get a **Google sign-in page** instead, access is set to *Anyone with a
Google Account*, not *Anyone*. Every ballot will then fail in the browser with a
CORS error and nothing reaches the Sheet. Fix it in **Deploy → Manage
deployments → edit (pencil) → Who has access: Anyone → Deploy**.

Apps Script serves the code from the deployment, not the editor. **Every time you
edit `Code.gs` you must publish a new version**: Deploy → Manage deployments →
pencil → Version: *New version* → Deploy. The `/exec` URL stays the same.

### What is stored

The **Votes** sheet has five columns and nothing more — the poster number is the
only identifier the ballot needs, and titles and presenters already live in the
abstract book, so duplicating them here would only go stale.

| column | why |
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | ordering, and lets you cut off late ballots after the deadline |
| `name` | the only duplicate-voter check there is; `tally()` flags repeats |
| `first` | poster number, worth 3 points |
| `second` | poster number, worth 2 points |
| `third` | poster number, worth 1 point |

Numbers are stored bare (`7`, not `P07`).

## 3. Publish

1. New GitHub repo, e.g. `icats-poster-vote`. Upload these files at the repo root.
2. Paste the `/exec` URL into `ENDPOINT` in `config.js`, commit.
3. Settings → Pages → Source **Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`.
4. Live in ~1 minute at `https://USERNAME.github.io/icats-poster-vote/`.

Test end to end before the conference: cast one ballot, confirm the row lands in
**Votes** with the name and the three poster numbers.

## 4. QR

Print one large QR of the plain Pages URL for the hall entrance, and put smaller ones
on the poster-session signage. There is nothing to hand out — voters just need the URL
and their own name.

## 5. On the day

- Open voting when the poster session is about half over.
- Announce the deadline twice; walk the hall with the QR sign in the last 30 minutes.
- To close early, set `OPEN: false` in `config.js` and commit, or set `CLOSES_AT`
  in advance, e.g. `"2026-09-10T16:15:00+09:00"`.

## 6. Results

**Poster vote → Tally results.** Writes the full ranking to the **Results** sheet;
top 8 win. Ties break on number of 1st choices, then 2nd choices.

The alert also lists any name that appears on more than one ballot. Those extra
ballots **are** included in the ranking, so delete them in **Votes** and tally again
before announcing.

Announce the rules beforehand, including the cap of two awards per research group —
apply it by skipping down the Results list if a third poster from one group lands in
the top 8.

## Notes

- Apps Script cannot answer a CORS preflight, so the POST uses `text/plain`. Don't
  change that header.
- `localStorage` blocks an accidental resubmit from the same phone, but nothing stops
  a determined person voting again from another device or browser. One ballot per
  person rests on the honour system plus the duplicate-name check at tally time.
- Self-voting is no longer blocked automatically. Announce the rule instead, or check
  the **Votes** sheet for presenters who ranked their own poster first.
- No dependencies, no build step, no API keys in the client.
